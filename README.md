#Git Cheat Sheet 

First `init` a new repository to work with:

```
$ git init REPO_NAME
$ cd REPO_NAME
```
**Note** Directories are not tracked, just add a `.keep` file

To ignore files add them to `.gitignore`:

```
log/*.log
```

To add just parts to the index we can use `git add -p` (`-p` as in "patch") 

## Disaster Recovery 

In case of deleted commits use `git reflog` and `git cherry-pick` to recover those commits:

```
$ git cherry-pick LOST_COMMIT_SHA1
```

**Note** Will be cleaned up once `git gc` ran

## Getting information out of history 

Use `git log --oneline --graph` to get condensed log view.

Use `git blame` to see **last** change for each line.

Use Â´git show COMMIT_SHA1` to get detailed information about commit (including diff).

Use `git log -S` to search in content of commits

## Branches

Branches are essential for any git workflow. To create a new branch run:

```
$ git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME
```

To list all your branches you can run (the active branch will be marked with a `*`)

```
$ git branch
```
